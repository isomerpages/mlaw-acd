#### <a id="Renewal of Registration"></a> Renewal of Registration

It is an <u>offence</u> if you act or hold out to be a regulated dealer without being registered or exempted. 

If your registration period is expiring in the next 3 months, and you intend to continue your business as a regulated dealer, you should renew your registration as soon as possible. It may take around 4 weeks for the Registrar to process an application for renewal before granting the renewal. It may take longer if additional information is required. If your renewal is not approved before the expiration of your registration, your registration will lapse and you will have to submit a new registration application.

**Note:** In your renewal application, your particulars will be auto-populated in the renewal application form. You should ensure that these are updated with the [Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority ("**ACRA**")](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}. The renewal process will take very little of your time if there are no changes to your registration information. Hence, we encourage you to submit your renewal application as soon as possible.

You may submit your application via the [GoBusiness Licensing Portal](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/licences){:target="_blank"}. You may refer to the [GoBusiness Licensing Guide for Regulated Dealers](/images/GoBusiness%20Licensing%20Guide%20For%20Regulated%20Dealers_ACD_20191127.pdf){:target="_blank"} for a step-by-step guide to the renewal application process.

The Registrar of Regulated Dealers may impose additional conditions or waive existing conditions for registration, for the renewed registration period.

#### <a id="Fees, Registering your Place(s) of Business and Period of Registration"></a> Fees, Registering your Place(s) of Business and Period of Registration
<b>Fees and registering your place(s) of business</b><br>
Regulated dealers must pay an application fee of S$140 for each renewal application to register with the Registrar. All payment must be made through [GoBusiness Licensing Portal](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/licences){:target="_blank"} using the following e-payment methods: PayPal, VISA, MasterCard, American Express or Discover.<br><br>
If the Registrar provides in-principle approval for your application, regulated dealers must pay a registration fee of S$300 per [place of business](https://acd.mlaw.gov.sg/registration-of-temporary-outlets/){:target="_blank"} per year calculated based on the number of outlets you operate and the period for which you register.

<b>Period of registration</b><br>
An applicant may apply for a specific class of registration that will determine the period of registration, i.e.:
1.  Class 1 (1 year duration);
2.  Class 2 (2 year duration); and
3.  Class 3 (3 year duration).


For the avoidance of doubt, the Registrar has the discretion to grant a different class of registration than the class of registration applied for.
