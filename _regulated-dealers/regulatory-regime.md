#### <a id="About the Regime"></a> About the Regime

<a href="/files/ML_TF_Risks_in_the_PSMD_Sector.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="/images/ML_TF_Risks_in_the_PSMD_Sector.jpg"></a>

The regime covers regulated dealers.

A “regulated dealer” is any person who carries on a business:<br>
(a)	of regulated dealing; or <br>
(b)	as an intermediary for regulated dealing.

“Regulated dealing” means: <br>
(a)	selling, offering for sale, purchasing for the purpose of resale, importing for sale, possessing for sale, or manufacturing any “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product”; or <br>
(b)	selling or redeeming any “asset-backed token”. 

**Examples**<br>
Regulated dealers include, but are not limited to, jewellers, bullion traders, jewellery wholesalers, jewellery retailers and secondhand goods dealers. The regime also applies to regulated dealers who are based overseas but carry on a business of regulated dealing in Singapore.

Intermediaries for regulated dealing who are covered under the regime include, but are not limited to, auction houses and trading platforms.

Importantly, the regime does **not** intend to cover individuals who make one-off purchases and subsequently decide to sell their items to a secondhand goods dealer. Further, pawnbrokers are **not** regulated dealers as they are already subject to AML/CFT/CPF measures under the Pawnbrokers Act 2015.

**What does the regime cover?**<br>
“Precious stones” (natural or otherwise) include diamonds, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, jade (including nephrite and jadeite), and pearls.

“Precious metals” include gold, silver, platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, and alloys with at least 2% in weight of any of the metals stated above.

“Precious products” include, but are not limited to, any jewellery, watch, apparel, accessory, ornament or other finished product that: <br>
(a) derives 50% or more of its value from any precious stone and/or precious metal making up, contained in, or attached to that product; or <br>
(b) is above the net price of S$20,000.

An “asset-backed token” is any token, certificate or instrument: <br>
(i) backed by one or more “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product”; and <br>
(ii) that entitles the holder to the “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product” or part of it (e.g. certificates or tokens).

Asset-backed tokens **do not include** securities or derivatives contracts within the meanings of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289), and commodity contracts within the meaning of the Commodity Trading Act (Cap. 48A). Securities contracts, derivatives contracts and commodity contracts are **not** covered under the regime.

#### <a id="Our Role in AML/CFT"></a> Our Role in AML/CFT/CPF 

Singapore is a member of the Financial Action Task Force ("**FATF**"), an inter-governmental body that sets international standards aimed to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing ("**ML/TF/PF**"), and the harm these illegal activities cause to society. There are currently more than 200 countries and jurisdictions committed to implementing anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism/countering proliferation financing ("**AML/CFT/CPF**") measures in accordance to the recommendations set by the FATF.

Designated non-financial businesses and professions ("**DNFBP**") in Singapore, such as the precious stones and precious metals dealers ("**PSMD**"), have a role to play to ensure that Singapore is effective in implementing its AML/CFT/CPF policies through the PSMD sector. The regulatory requirements on the PSMD sector are set out in the PSPM Act and the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering, Terrorism Financing and Proliferation Financing) Regulations 2019 ("**PMLTF Regulations**"). Regulated dealers should also refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://acd.mlaw.gov.sg/guidelines/">Guidelines for Regulated Dealers</a> (Published Date: 2 May 2024).

Please refer to the [compliance requirements](/entity-based-requirements/) for more information on how to implement an effective AML/CFT/CPF framework for your business.
