#### What is money laundering and terrorism financing?
Money laundering ("**ML**") is the process of concealing the proceeds of a crime so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources. Terrorism financing ("**TF**") is the funding of terrorism or terrorist groups, either via legitimate or illegitimate means.

#### Who are regulated dealers?
Registered dealers are regulated by the Ministry of Law under the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act 2019 ("**PSPM Act**") for the prevention of ML and TF only. The Ministry of Law does not audit, supervise or certify the registered dealer for any other purpose. 

Hence, registered dealers are not allowed to represent or suggest that their businesses have been approved or endorsed by the Ministry of Law in any way. They are to also ensure that their websites, representations and publicity materials do not cause the public to misconstrue that the Registrar of Regulated Dealers is regulating them beyond anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (“**AML/CFT**”) matters. Customers should exercise due caution and the Ministry of Law makes no warranty or representation as to any aspect of the business of the registered dealer. 

Investments are not covered under the regulations.

#### What does it mean to me as a customer?
You may be required to provide your personal information and identification documents for verification purposes when you purchase the precious stones, precious metals and/or precious products ("**PSPMs**") from regulated dealers. Some common PSPM include diamond and gold jewellery, platinum wedding bands and gold or silver bullion bars. A full list of PSPM is available under our [Regulatory Regime](/regulatory-regime/). By providing these information and documents promptly, you play a part in protecting the precious stones and precious metals dealers sector and Singapore from being misused for criminal activities.

#### What if I do not give my identifying information to the regulated dealer?
The law prohibits regulated dealers from completing the transaction with you, if you do not provide these information as requested. 

#### What happens to my personal information?
All personal information provided by you to the regulated dealers will be kept confidential in accordance with the [Personal Data Protection Act 2012](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/nric-extracts){:target="_blank"}. You may refer to the [Notice for Customers](/notice-for-customers/) for more information.
