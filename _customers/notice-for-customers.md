#### **Notice for Customers**

The Notice for Customers explains that regulated dealers are required to collect identifying information from customers under the regulatory regime. Regulated dealers may wish to consider using the Notice for Customers to educate their customers on the anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism/countering proliferation financing ("**AML/CFT/CPF**") requirements.

#### What does it mean to me as a customer?
You may be required to provide your personal information and identification documents for verification purposes when you purchase the precious stones, precious metals and/or precious products ("**PSPMs**") from regulated dealers. Some common PSPM include diamond and gold jewellery, platinum wedding bands and gold or silver bullion bars. A full list of PSPM is available under our [Regulatory Regime](/regulatory-regime/). By providing these information and documents promptly, you play a part in protecting the precious stones and precious metals dealers sector and Singapore from being misused for criminal activities.

#### What if I do not give my identifying information to the regulated dealer?
The law prohibits regulated dealers from completing the transaction with you, if you do not provide these information as requested. 

#### What happens to my personal information?
All personal information provided by you to the regulated dealers will be kept confidential in accordance with the [Personal Data Protection Act 2012](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/nric-extracts){:target="_blank"}. You may refer to the [Notice for Customers](/notice-for-customers/) for more information.
