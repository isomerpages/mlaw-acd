<p>Dear Regulated Dealers</p>
<p></p>
<p>In light of rapidly evolving cyber threats and the recent surge in deepfake-related
incidents globally, including impersonation scams and fraudulent activities,
the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“<strong>MAS</strong>”) has published
two papers concerning cyber risks associated with <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/circulars/cyber-risks-associated-with-generative-artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">generative artificial intelligence (“</a><strong><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/circulars/cyber-risks-associated-with-generative-artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GenAI</a></strong>
<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/circulars/cyber-risks-associated-with-generative-artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">”)</a>and <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/circulars/cyber-risks-associated-with-deepfakes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">deepfakes</a>.
These papers aim to increase awareness by providing an overview of the
cyber threats associated with GenAI and deepfakes, the risk implications
and possible mitigation measures that could be taken to address the risks.</p>
<p>Regulated dealers should be cognisant of the evolving cyber developments
and their risk implications, and are encouraged to review the two papers
and – where applicable – implement the recommended (appropriate) risk mitigation
measures as part of your internal controls, at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points from Paper on Cyber Risks Associated with GenAI</strong>
</p>
<p>GenAI is now used by cyber threat actors to create (convincing) phishing
emails, fake documents, and even realistic identities via synthetic media.
Criminals may – amongst other things – abuse GenAI to circumvent customer
due diligence (“<strong>CDD</strong>”) / enhanced customer due diligence
(“<strong>ECDD</strong>”) measures performed by your staff. Regulated dealers
should note the:-</p>
<p>• <strong>Emerging attack vectors</strong> such as AI-generated scams and
fraud risks (e.g. identify theft) affecting CDD/ECDD processes;</p>
<p>• <strong>Risks identified</strong> across various business aspects (i.e.
people, process and technology) such as unauthorised access to customer
data, manipulation of transaction records, and injection of false identities
or beneficial ownership information via AI-created (forged) documentation,
data manipulation and bypassing of data system guardrails; and</p>
<p>• <strong>Possible mitigation measures</strong> such as the strengthening
of data security and governance, enhancing front-line (retail) and compliance
staff awareness of GenAI-enabled threats, implementing anomaly detection
controls, and promptly reviewing transactional or customer onboarding activity
that are incongruent with standard customer profiles.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Key Points from Paper on Cyber Risks Associated with Deepfakes</strong>
</p>
<p>Deepfakes (e.g. digitally manipulated audio, video, or documents convincingly
replicating a person’s likeness or authority) are a growing vector that
facilitate impersonation, falsified documents and fraudulent transactions.
Regulated dealers with remote or cross-border transactions, for example,
are at elevated risk of deepfake or AI-enabled compromise of your anti-money
laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and countering proliferation
financing (“<strong>AML/CFT/CPF</strong>”) processes and measures. Regulated
dealers should note that the:-</p>
<p>• <strong>Techniques </strong>include AI-powered impersonation, fake instructions
for payment or to access sensitive customer information, and altered video
or call content submitted for remote identification and verification of
customers’ identity in response to CDD/ECDD checks;</p>
<p>• <strong>Vulnerable areas</strong> include non-face-to-face transactions
and CDD/ECDD performed, transaction authorisations, and ongoing customer
verification – including those involving high-risk customers and/or customers
outside of Singapore; and</p>
<p>• <strong>Possible risk mitigation measures</strong> include (where applicable)
conducting robust documentary, call and/or video verification, implementing
deepfake detection tools, strengthening processes and controls for high-risk
transactions and educating staff on red flags and on deepfake and GenAI-enabled
risks.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do?</strong>
</p>
<p>Regulated dealers should keep abreast of evolving cyber risks and threats,
relevant cyber risk advisories and ensure that your risk mitigation measures,
internal controls, staff training, and technological and system defenses
are reviewed and enhanced where necessary. You are encouraged to review
how cyber-enabled threats may intersect directly and/or impact your business
in fulfilling AML/CFT/CPF obligations, such as CDD/ECDD measures when dealing
with transactions and customers. Regulated dealers should regularly review
your risk assessment and internal policies, procedures and controls in
place to ensure that they remain updated and relevant, thereby ensuring
that they (i) address risks posed by evolving technology – including but
not limited to GenAI and deepfake technologies – and (ii) are in alignment
with AML/CFT/CPF requirements.</p>
