<p>Dear Regulated Dealers</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to alert you to the Police’s reminder for vigilance against <strong><a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20250702_police_advisory_on_government_official_impersonation_scams_involving_physical_collection" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">government official impersonation scams (GOIS) involving physical collection of monies or gold bars from scam victims</a></strong>.
Since June 2025, at least 80 cases were reported with total losses amounting
to at least $6.7 million. In this scam variant, victims would receive unsolicited
calls from scammers impersonating officials from banks (e.g. DBS, Maybank),
financial institutions (e.g. NTUC, UnionPay) or government agencies (e.g.
ICA).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The scammers would claim that victims had:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>conducted banking or financial transactions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>outstanding premiums associated with a new or expiring insurance policy
under victim’s name; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>phone numbers (or other personal/banking information) registered under
victim’s details that were found to be involved in fraudulent activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>When victims denied performing such transactions, they would be transferred
to another scammer claiming to be a government official (e.g. MAS, SPF,
Ministry of Law, foreign police). This scammer would accuse victims of
being involved in criminal activities (e.g. money laundering). The scammers
would then ask victims to withdraw monies, <strong>purchase gold bars or declare valuables owned (e.g. jewellery, luxury watches)</strong> and
meet unknown subjects to hand over these valuables for investigation purposes.
In some cases, victims were instructed to place the valuables in discreet
locations for unknown subjects to collect.&nbsp; Victims would realise
that they had been scammed when the scammers become uncontactable or when
they seek verification with SPF.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>To protect your customers, please remain vigilant of suspicious transactions</strong>,
such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Elderly customers making unusually large purchases (e.g. jewellery, luxury watches)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customers appearing distressed or receiving phone calls while making purchases</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customers refusing to provide information on the reason for the purchases</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customers appearing to be in a hurry to complete the transactions</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customers seeking to complete the transactions without giving due consideration to what they are purchasing (e.g. value, design)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customers refusing to provide information on the reason for the purchases</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
