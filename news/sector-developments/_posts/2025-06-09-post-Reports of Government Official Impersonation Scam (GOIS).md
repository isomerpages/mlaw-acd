<p>Dear Regulated Dealers</p>
<p>The police seek your support in combating scams. Since early March 2025,
the police have received several reports of Government Official Impersonation
Scam (GOIS) featuring the impersonation of banks and government officials.
The victim is convinced to hand his/her cash, jewellery, and/or bank cards
to an agent of a supposed “Police Officer” for investigation purposes.
In some instances, the victim is instructed to purchase gold bars before
parting them to an agent of the scammer.</p>
<p>To help protect your customers, we encourage you to consider displaying
the<em> </em>infographic below at any appropriate location in your shopfront.
Additionally, please remain vigilant of suspicious transactions, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
</ul>
