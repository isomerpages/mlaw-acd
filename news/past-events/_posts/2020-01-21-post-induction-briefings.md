The Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Division ("**ACD**") of the Ministry of Law organised induction briefings for the registered dealers in the Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers sector in 2019. 

The aim of the briefing was to provide an overview of the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act 2019 ("**PSPM Act**"). Registered dealers may refer to the ["**FAQs**"](https://va.ecitizen.gov.sg/cfp/customerPages/mlaw/explorefaq.aspx){:target="_blank"} under the Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers section for Frequently Asked Questions relating to the regulatory regime.
