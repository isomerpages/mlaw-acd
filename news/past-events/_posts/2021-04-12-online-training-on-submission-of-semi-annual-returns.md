The Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Division ("**ACD**") of Ministry of Law is organising online trainings in May 2021 for registered Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers ("**PSMD**"), to provide guidance on the submission of semi-annual returns. The training is only available in English. 

As a regulated dealer, you are required to submit mandatory semi-annual returns related to your business and transactions in six-months periods with effect from 1 January 2021. The first reporting period is from 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021, and the submission will be due within 30 days, i.e. by 30 July 2021. More information on this reporting requirement can be found [here](https://acd.mlaw.gov.sg/news/notices-from-the-registrar/reporting-requirement-for-regulated-dealers-with-effect-from-1-January-2021){:target="_blank"}.

The training aims to provide guidance on:
 - understanding the information required for submission; and
 - how to submit the semi-annual returns.

We would like to thank all participants for their support of this event in May 2021.

Regulated dealers will have to submit the semi-annual returns electronically through the <i>my</i> Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealerâ€™s Portal (<i>my</i>Pal). The instruction guide to use <i>my</i>Pal will be available soon.

Please watch this [guidance video](https://youtu.be/Jpcj4iYSOSM){:target="_blank"} to preview <i>my</i>Pal and how to submit the semi-annual returns.
