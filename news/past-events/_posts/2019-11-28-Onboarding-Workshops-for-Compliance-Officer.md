The Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Division ("**ACD**") of the Ministry of Law will be organising Onboarding Workshops ("**OBW**") for the registered dealers in the Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers sector. 

The OBW aims to enable the **compliance officer** of registered dealers to:

(a) Perform an assessment of the money laundering ("**ML**") and terrorism financing ("**TF**") risks faced by their business; and <br>
(b) Develop internal policies, procedures and controls ("**IPPC**") to manage and effectively mitigate the ML/TF risks.
