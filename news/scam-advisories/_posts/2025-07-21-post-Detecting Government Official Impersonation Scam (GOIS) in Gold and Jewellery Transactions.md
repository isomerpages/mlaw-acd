<p>Dear Regulated Dealers</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to draw your attention to a concerning rise in cases where
mules or victims were instructed to buy gold bars or jewellery in Government
Official Impersonation Scams (“<strong>GOIS</strong>”). As highlighted
in our previous advisories dated 9 June 2025 and 4 July 2025, at least
80 GOIS cases have been reported since June 2025, resulting in losses of
at least $6.7 million.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Amid these worrying trends, we are encouraged by a recent case in which
MoneyMax Jewellery Pte. Ltd.’s vigilant staff successfully thwarted a scam
attempt. As a result of the staff's alertness and keen observation, the
Police were able to intervene swiftly and prevent monetary loss of $20,900
to a scam victim. Click <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/Media-Room/News/20250714_staff_of_moneymax_presented_with_community_partnership_award_at_woodlands_police_division" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to
access the Police press release on 14 July 2025 regarding its recognition
of MoneyMax Jewellery Pte. Ltd. staff’s contribution towards detecting
and preventing a case of GOIS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This positive outcome reinforces the important role that alert and well-informed
frontline staff of regulated dealers play in working with the Police to
deter, detect and prevent crime. Such outcomes are made possible especially
when there is clear direction from senior management and ongoing efforts
by regulated dealers to train staff to identify and handle suspicious indicators.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You may want to pay close attention to the following red flags which could
be indicators of customers acting as mules or who have fallen victim to
scams:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Customers making unusually large gold purchases (e.g. jewellery, luxury
watches)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers appearing distressed or receiving phone calls while making purchases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers refusing to provide information on the reason for the purchases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers appearing to be in a hurry to complete the transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers seeking to complete transactions without due consideration of
their purchases (e.g. value, design)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers being reluctant or unable to produce physical credit cards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers providing payment details that do not match their known customer
profile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers attempting to resell substantial quantities of gold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers cancelling transactions when they are almost complete</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers requesting to split payment using multiple cards without apparent
reason</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>If you or your staff encounter customers who exhibit the above red flags,
the following actions may be considered:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Inquiring about the purpose of purchases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requesting physical cards when customers pay using digital wallets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conducting Customer Due Diligence (“<strong>CDD</strong>”)<strong> </strong>by
requesting identification cards or passports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verifying the cardholder's name against CDD information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contacting your processing bank for advice on suspicious transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observing customer reactions to additional requests for any unusual behaviour</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We strongly encourage you to ensure that your frontline staff are familiar
with these indicators and appropriate response actions.</p>
<p></p>

Police Centre. If you have any information relating to such crimes or are
