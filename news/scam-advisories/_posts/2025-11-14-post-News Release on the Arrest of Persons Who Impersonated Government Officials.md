<p>Dear Regulated Dealers</p>
<p>On 4 September 2025, Ministry of Law (“<strong>MinLaw</strong>”) and the
Singapore Police Force (“<strong>SPF</strong>”)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/advisory-on-scammers-impersonating-officers-from-the-ministry-of-law/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">alerted members of the public to scammers impersonating officers from MinLaw</a>.&nbsp;
We would like to share the SPF news release on 9 November 2025&nbsp;regarding
the arrest of persons who posed as purported officers from MinLaw and MAS
to scam a victim out of more than $400,000.</p>
<p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU AND WHAT CAN YOU DO.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Police have observed an increasing trend of Malaysian nationals</strong>  <strong>travelling to Singapore</strong>  <strong>to assist scam syndicates in collecting</strong>  <strong>cash</strong>, <strong>gold</strong>, <strong>and valuables</strong>  <strong>from scam victims</strong>.</p>
<p>In this case, the victim first received a call from an individual claiming
to be from a bank, who alleged that a credit card had been applied in her
name. When the victim refuted this claim, the call was transferred to persons
posing as MinLaw and MAS officers, who then informed her of involvement
in a case of money laundering. The victim was presented with fake staff
passes from both government agencies along with other supporting documents
via WhatsApp to lend credibility to the deception. <strong>The victim was instructed to transfer $1 million from her bank account to her credit card and then use the credit card to purchase gold worth over $412,000 before handing over to an unknown person on the same day</strong>.
The victim subsequently made a police report, which led to the successful
arrest of the two men believed to be part of a transnational scam syndicate.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore Government officers, including MinLaw officers, will&nbsp;never&nbsp;ask members of the public to do the following</strong>  <strong>over the phone</strong>:</p>
