The Public Sector Transformation (“**PST**”) Awards is a Whole-of-Government pinnacle platform to recognise and reward public officers and public agencies for excellence in their work and organisational practices. There are 12 categories of awards recognised at this PST Awards Celebration.

We are pleased to announce that through our nomination, the Singapore Jewellers Association (“**SJA**”) was awarded the Star Partner Award at the PST Awards 2020.

This Award is an acknowledgement of SJA’s key partnership with the Ministry of Law (“**MinLaw**”) in the development and implementation of the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act 2019 (“**PSPM Act**”). SJA adopted a professional approach towards the PSPM Act and actively participated in MinLaw’s industry association consultation meetings, sharing feedback and suggestions on behalf of their members and the sector at large.

Through the close partnership established with SJA, MinLaw also had a better understanding of the concerns faced by the regulated dealers in the sector and was able to correspondingly assist by availing more resources that are useful to the regulated dealers in complying with the PSPM Act. This led to a series of end-products such as collaterals and guidance materials that are suitable for the whole sector.
