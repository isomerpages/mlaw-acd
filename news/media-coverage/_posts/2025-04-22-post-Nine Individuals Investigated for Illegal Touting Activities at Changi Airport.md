Officers from the Singapore Police Force (“**SPF**”), Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (“**ICA**”), Ministry of Manpower (“**MOM**”) and Changi Airport Group (“**CAG**”) conducted a joint operation at Changi Airport on 22 March 2025 (the “**Operation**”). 

Investigations found that the individuals – who held Work Permits, S Passes, or Social Visit Passes – had approached travellers of the same nationality to solicit them to carry gold and mobile phones back to their home countries. These items were intended to be handed over to their counterparts in their home countries, in exchange for a cash reward. Following the conclusion of the investigations, eight individuals had their work passes revoked by MOM and one had his Short-Term Visit Pass cancelled by ICA. All of them will be deported and barred from re-entering Singapore. Regulated dealers are advised to exercise vigilance when dealing with customers who may be involved in touting activities at Changi Airport.

Regulated dealers may deal with foreigners on work passes or foreign visitors on Short-Term Visit Passes who are acting on behalf of foreign customers.  We remind regulated dealers that foreigners on work passes are only allowed to work in the occupation, and for the employer, as approved for their work pass. They are not allowed to operate or participate in any other business. Foreign visitors on Short-Term Visit Passes are prohibited from engaging in any form of employment (paid or unpaid), business, profession, or occupation in Singapore during their stay in Singapore. The Singapore Government takes a serious view of illegal activities and will not hesitate to take firm action against individuals who flout our laws.

If you observe any suspicious behaviours or activities that may indicate money laundering or other illegal activities, please lodge a suspicious transaction report. If you witness or suspect a crime in progress, please call 999 for Police assistance.
