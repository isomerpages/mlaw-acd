<p>A precious stones and precious metals dealer (“<strong>PSMD</strong>”)
was fined S$35,000 on 19 November 2024 under the Precious Stones and Precious
Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering, Terrorism Financing and Proliferation
Financing) Act (“<strong>PSPM Act</strong>”). The PSMD had sold valuables
worth more than S$313,000 in total to customers, and over $140,000 of that
amount was later traced to two Singaporean victims of a malware scam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two employees of the PSMD had processed the payments without conducting
the necessary checks, despite having reasons to suspect that the funds
were linked to money laundering activities. The offences came to light
after the two malware scam victims alerted the police.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We remind regulated dealers that under the PSPM Act, all regulated dealers
are required by law to:-</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Perform Customer Due Diligence or Enhanced Customer Due Diligence measures
under circumstances that are prescribed by the Act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit Cash Transaction Report with the Suspicious Transaction Reporting
Office (“<strong>STRO</strong>”) for cash and cash equivalent transactions
exceeding S$20,000; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File Suspicious Transaction Report with STRO where there is suspicion
of money laundering/terrorism financing/proliferation financing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
