<p><strong><u>The Ministry of Law imposes Composition Sum amounting to S$420,000 on Singapore Precious Metals Exchange Pte Ltd and its Chief Executive Officer</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Ministry of Law (“<strong>MinLaw</strong>”) has imposed a composition sum
amounting to S$210,000 on Singapore Precious Metals Exchange Pte. Ltd.
(“<strong>SPME</strong>”) and another sum amounting to S$210,000 on its
chief executive officer (“<strong>CEO</strong>”), Victor Foo Seang Kwang
(“<strong>Mr Foo</strong>”). These were imposed for breaches of anti-money
laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (“<strong>AML/CFT</strong>”)
requirements under the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention
of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act 2019 (“<strong>PSPM Act</strong>”)
and Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering
and Terrorism Financing) Regulations 2019 (“<strong>PMLTF Regulations</strong>”).</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPME is a precious
stones and metals dealer registered under the PSPM Act. Its business activities
include sales and purchase of gold and silver bullion through its online
store and operation of an online trading platform facilitating direct sales
of gold and silver bullion between its customers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MinLaw’s
inspection of SPME uncovered serious breaches of the AML/CFT requirements
under the PSPM Act and PMLTF Regulations between 2019 to 2022, including
SPME’s failure to:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(<strong>a</strong>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take appropriate steps
to properly identify, assess and understand SPME’s money laundering and
terrorism financing (“<strong>ML/TF</strong>”) risk in relation to its
customers;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(<strong>b</strong>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identify and assess
the ML/TF risk in relation to the business practice and take appropriate
measures to manage and mitigate such risks before launching a new business
practice;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(<strong>c</strong>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perform enhanced customer
due diligence on its customers; and</p>
<p></p>
<p>(<strong>d</strong>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conduct ongoing monitoring
of transactions to ensure customer profiles are consistent with their gold
purchases and sales.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the above offences, MinLaw has imposed a composition sum amounting to S$210,000
on SPME.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally, a composition sum amounting to S$210,000 has also been imposed
on Mr Foo, as CEO and director of SPME. Investigations found that the key
breaches are attributable to Mr Foo, for failing to prevent or stop the
commission of the offences by SPME.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SPME and Mr Foo have paid the composition sum. They are in the process
of taking remedial actions as directed by MinLaw, to address deficiencies
related to the aforesaid offences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A separate criminal investigation by the Singapore Police Force’s Commercial
Affairs Department against SPME is currently ongoing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Regulated dealers dealing with customers or transactions that present higher
ML/TF risks must take commensurate measures to mitigate such risks.&nbsp;
The senior management of regulated dealers must ensure that higher-risk
customers and transactions are identified and subject to robust AML/CFT
controls.&nbsp; MinLaw will not hesitate to take firm regulatory action
against regulated dealers that fail to meet the regulatory requirements
for AML/CFT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
