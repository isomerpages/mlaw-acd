The Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Division ("**ACD**") of the Ministry of Law will be organising induction briefings for the registered dealers in the Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers sector in the upcoming months. Each registered dealer may send up to 2 representatives.

The aim of the briefing is to provide an overview of the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act 2019 ("**PSPM Act**").

An invitation email from ACD will be sent to registered dealers to sign up for the induction briefing. Registered dealers may refer to the ["**FAQs**"](https://va.ecitizen.gov.sg/cfp/customerPages/mlaw/explorefaq.aspx){:target="_blank"} under the Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers section for Frequently Asked Questions relating to the regulatory regime.
