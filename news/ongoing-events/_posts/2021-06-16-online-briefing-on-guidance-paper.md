The Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Division (“**ACD**”) of Ministry of Law is organising online briefings in July 2021 for registered precious stones and precious metals dealer (“**PSMD**”) to take regulated dealers through the [Guidance Paper](/images/Guidance Paper_20210616.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

In the Guidance Paper, MinLaw has identified four key areas for improvement, namely:

1. Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing (“**ML/TF**”) Risk Awareness and Understanding of Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism ("**AML/CFT**") Requirements;

2. Risk Assessment and Internal Policies, Procedures and Controls (“**IPPC**”);

3. Customer Due Diligence (“**CDD**”) and Cash Transaction Reporting (“**CTR**”); and

4. Enhanced Customer Due Diligence (“**ECDD**”).

Each key area for improvement comprises the following elements:

1. Regulatory obligations – To remind dealers of the regulatory requirements;

2. Case examples of good practices observed – To share and acknowledge good practices;

3. Case examples of lapses observed – To highlight key findings and the causes which led to the findings; and

4. Key learning points – To highlight MinLaw’s supervisory expectations.

MinLaw will be conducting online briefings on 7 July 2021 and 12 July 2021 to take regulated dealers through the Guidance Paper. The briefings will only be available in English.
