The Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Division ("**ACD**") of the Ministry of Law will be organising Onboarding Workshops for the registered dealers in the Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers sector in the upcoming months. 

The Onboarding Workshop aims to enable the **compliance officer** of registered dealers to:

(a) Perform an assessment of the money laundering ("**ML**") and terrorism financing ("**TF**") risks faced by their business; and

(b) Develop internal policies, procedures and controls ("**IPPC**") to manage and effectively mitigate the ML/TF risks.

Registered dealers may send your compliance officer to attend the workshop. Please click [here](https://go.gov.sg/onboardingworkshop){:target="_blank"} to indicate your interest.
