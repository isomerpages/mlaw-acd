Dear Regulated Dealer,

The terrorism threat to Singapore remains high. With the relaxation of the pandemic restriction and resumption of cross-border travel, we have to stay vigilant to the possibility of a terrorist attack against Singapore or its interests overseas. 

**Read the Singapore Terrorism Threat Assessment Report (“STTAR”) 2022 published by the Ministry of Home Affairs to find out more.**

Full report at this [link](https://www.mha.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/singapore-terrorism-threat-assessment-report-2022.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

#### What is STTAR?

STTAR is an annual terrorism threat assessment report which highlights information on the terrorism threat to Singapore and the importance of public vigilance and preparedness in Singapore’s defence against terrorism.

#### What are the 5 key highlights in STTAR 2022?

1.  **_Terrorism threat to Singapore remains high._** There is currently no specific intelligence of an imminent terrorist attack, but Singapore continues to feature as a target on terrorist propaganda. With the relaxation of pandemic restrictions and resumption of cross-border travel, terrorist elements may become more active.
2.  **_Threats from Islamist terrorist groups and their violent ideology persists._**  Their virtual network of supporters continues to disseminate propaganda, raise funds and plot attacks.
3.  **_Spread of radical ideologies online has fuelled the self-radicalisation threat_** in Singapore.
4.  **_Ongoing development abroad_**, such as in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Ukraine, could also **_affect our security landscape_**.
5.  **_Public vigilance and preparedness_** are key components of our defence against terrorism.

#### What can you <u>do as a regulated dealer</u>?
*   Regulated dealers are required to take reasonable measures related to targeted financial sanctions and terrorism financing. Where a regulated dealer has reason to suspect that the customer or any person on whose behalf the customer is acting, is a terrorist or terrorist entity under the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act ("**TSOFA**"), or a designated person under the relevant United Nations ("**UN**") Regulations, a regulated dealer must:<br>
	(a) Decline to enter into any transaction with the customer;<br>
	(b) Terminate any transaction entered into with the customer; and <br>
	(c) File a suspicious transaction report and report to the police.
<br><br>
*   Such measures include, but are not limited to, conducting name screening against the terrorists and terrorist entities under the TSOFA, and the lists of designated persons under the relevant UN Regulations, against the following information sources: <br>
	(a) MHA’s Inter-Ministry Committee on Terrorist Designation ("**IMC-TD**") [website](https://www.mha.gov.sg/what-we-do/managing-security-threats/countering-the-financing-of-terrorism) on terrorist designation and legislation for countering the financing of terrorism. <br>
	(b) MAS’ [website](https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/anti-money-laundering/targeted-financial-sanctions/lists-of-designated-individuals-and-entities) on targeted financial sanctions under the UN Regulations for the lists of designated individuals and entities. <br><br>

*   The Ministry of Law will be rolling out a screening tool in <i>my</i>Pal to help registered dealers conduct screening against the lists of designated persons and terrorists and terrorist entities under the TSOFA.  We will share more details on the screening tool soon.  

#### What can do you do <u>as a member of the public</u>?
