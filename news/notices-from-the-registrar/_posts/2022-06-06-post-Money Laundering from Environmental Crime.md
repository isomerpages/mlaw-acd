**What are environmental crimes?**  

These generally refer to any criminal offence that harms and endangers the environment. Types of environment crimes **includes illegal mining**, which refers to mining activity that is undertaken without state permission or with state permission obtained through corruption.

**Why are environmental crimes a concern?**

Some of the key concerns highlighted in a Financial Action Task Force (“**FATF**”) Report are:

1. Environmental crime is estimated to be **amongst the highest proceeds-generating crime** in the world.
2. **Criminals frequently mix legal and illegal goods and payments** early in the resource supply chains to conceal their illicit source. This makes it difficult to detect suspicious financial flows later in the value chain.
3. **Criminals may use ‘shell and front’ companies to launder gains** from environmental crimes such as illegal mining. 
 

**What can you do?**

Regulated Dealers are encouraged to:

1. **Be alert to the potential risk indicators** outlined in the FATF Report such as customers with mining licences operating in or around conflict zones or transactions with frequent payments from companies involved in mining to a recipient unrelated to the person’s activity or business.
2. **Take the appropriate mitigation measures** such as reporting suspicious transactions to guard against the risk that your business may be abused, where relevant.
