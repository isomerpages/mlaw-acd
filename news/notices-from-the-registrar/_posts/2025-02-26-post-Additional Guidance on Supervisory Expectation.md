<p>Dear Regulated Dealer</p>
<strong>Additional Guidance on Assessment of Customer Risk, Identification of Material Red Flags, Source of Wealth Establishment and Ongoing Monitoring of Customers and their Transactions</strong><br>
<br>To further strengthen the anti-money laundering, countering the financing
of terrorism and countering proliferation financing (“<strong>AML/CFT/CPF</strong>”)
controls in the Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers (“<strong>PSMD</strong>”)
sector, we have prepared a <a href="/files/Additional_Guidance_PSMD.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> guidance document</a> which outlines <strong>additional supervisory expectations</strong> for
regulated dealers to the <a href="/images/Guidance Paper_20210616.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Guidance Paper issued on 16 Jun 2021</a>. Observations
from recent AML/CFT/CPF inspections of regulated dealers have highlighted
areas where a more robust and consistent approach should be taken in relation
to the regulated dealers’ application of their AML/CFT/CPF controls in
certain areas.<br>
<br><strong>A.</strong>  <strong>Assessment of Customer Risk</strong>
<br><br>Consider money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing
(“<strong>ML/TF/PF</strong>”) risks emanating from customers with ML/TF/PF
red flags.<br>
<br><strong>Some examples of material red flags that were followed up by regulated dealers:</strong>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A customer who returned on the same day to purchase more gold bars in
cash, which was not usual in that instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A purchase of gold bars using Bitcoin with intention of selling back the
gold bars immediately for a payout to a bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A purchase and sale back of gold bars within a short period of time, incurring
losses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A payment for a luxury watch received from multiple bank accounts.
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
After performing further due diligence measures, suspicious transaction
reports (“<strong>STRs</strong>”) were filed by the regulated dealers in
relation to some of these customers.
<br><br><strong>B. Source of Wealth (“SOW”) establishment</strong>
<br><br>Apply rigor in assessing the plausibility of SOW, commensurate with the
level of ML/TF risks
<br><br><strong>Example of a good practice:</strong><br>
<br>A regulated dealer noted that the payments for a customer’s jewellery
were to be received from a third-party company. The regulated dealer enquired
on the relationship between the customer and the company and requested
the customer to furnish the company ownership reports to support his claim
that he owned the company.<br>
<br><strong>C. Ongoing Monitoring Controls and Close Oversight over Higher Risk Accounts</strong><br>
<br>Ensure that ongoing monitoring controls consider the customer’s risk profile.<br>
<br>In addition to the enclosed guidance document, we will also like to bring
regulated dealers’ attention to the following additional guidance on STR
filing timelines:
<br>
<br><strong>STR Filing Timelines&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>STRs should be filed as soon as reasonably practicable upon the establishment
of suspicion
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>“As soon as reasonably practicable” should be no longer than 5 business
days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will include some flexibility for exceptions. e.g. Prioritise STR
filing for higher risk cases; and STRs for targeted financial sanctions/
sanctions cases are to be filed within 1 business day, if not immediately.
<br>
</p></li>
</ul>
The additional guidance above will also be included in the next revised
copy of the Guidelines for Regulated Dealers that will be published.
<br>
<p></p>
<strong>What Can You Do?</strong><br>
<br>This set of further guidance does not impose new regulatory requirements
on regulated dealers.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>However, regulated dealers should benchmark this guidance against the
practices and supervisory expectations set out within, in a risk-based
and proportionate manner, and conduct a gap analysis, taking into account
the risk profile of their business activities and customers.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Where gaps are identified, regulated dealers should remediate or enhance
their AML/CFT/CPF framework and controls in a timely manner.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Senior management should exercise close oversight of the gap analysis
and ensure the effective implementation of follow-up actions, as appropriate.
<br>
<br>Thank you.
