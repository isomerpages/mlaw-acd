<p>Dear Registered Dealer,</p>
<p>As part of Singapore’s continuing efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of its anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism
("<strong>AML/CFT</strong>") regime, and to keep pace with best practices
as recommended by the Financial Action Task Force ("<strong>FATF</strong>"),
Singapore had published its updated Terrorism Financing National Risk Assessment
("<strong>TF NRA</strong>") and National Strategy for Countering the Financing
of Terrorism ("<strong>NSCFT</strong>") in July 2024.</p>
<p>To support this effort, ACD has prepared the following key highlights
from the TF NRA and the NSCFT for registered dealers to note and take action.</p>
<p><strong><u>TF NRA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore’s 2024 TF NRA presents an updated overview of Singapore’s TF
risk environment and identifies the latest key TF threats and vulnerabilities
stemming from global, regional, and domestic developments.</p>
<p>The TF NRA will enable supervisory authorities and the private sector
to adopt a targeted and risk-focused approach when updating and implementing
CFT risk mitigation measures.</p>
<p><strong>TF</strong>  <strong>threat of raising and moving funds for terrorists and terrorist activities overseas, including in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and by radicalised individuals within Singapore</strong> remains
pertinent in Singapore’s context.</p>
<p>Singapore’s status as an international financial, business, and transport
hub, coupled with robust connectivity, a substantial number of transient
visitors, and geographical proximity to countries harbouring active terrorist
groups, heightens Singapore’s vulnerability to TF threats.</p>
<p><strong>Areas at risk of being exploited for TF </strong>include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Money remittances (or cross border money transfer service providers) and banks</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital payment token (DPT) service providers (or virtual asset service providers)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential location for couriers to collect or move cash for delivery across borders</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the 2024 TF NRA, the <strong>precious stones and precious metals dealers </strong>("<strong>PSMD</strong>")<strong> sector</strong> is
assessed as presenting <strong>medium-low TF risk. </strong>PSMDs are more
vulnerable to TF risk due to the following factors:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Precious stones and precious metals ("<strong>PSPM</strong>") generally
possess <strong>high intrinsic value</strong> in a relatively compact form
that tend to maintain or increase in value over time, which potentially
makes them attractive to terrorist financiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There remain <strong>varied levels of awareness of TF risks and AML/CFT controls</strong> and
further improvements can be made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The challenge of tracing specific items and the global market for PSPM
also make it easier for terrorist financiers to <strong>potentially exploit cross-border transactions</strong> or <strong>move PSPM across borders</strong> to
obscure paper trails, which makes law enforcement investigations more challenging.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore<strong> </strong>has also developed its<strong> NSCFT</strong> which
focuses on <strong>three objectives</strong>:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Prevent</strong>: Proactively deter prospective terrorists, terrorist
organisations, and sympathisers from exploiting Singapore’s open economy
for TF activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Detect</strong>: Promptly identify and trace TF activities through
robust monitoring and tracking of red flag indicators, especially in high-risk
sectors and emerging TF typologies of concern; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disrupt</strong>: Take strong and resolute actions against terrorists,
terrorist organisations, and sympathisers seeking to raise, move, and use
funds for terrorism activities, both locally and abroad.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The NSCFT also highlights the measures taken to strengthen AML/CFT measures
for the PSMD sector, including the requirement to conduct CDD for PSPM
transactions involving payment received in DPT above SGD 20,000, and the
screening module within <em>my</em> Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealer’s
Portal (<strong><em>my</em>Pal</strong>) to aid PSMDs in screening for
designated individuals and entities to comply with targeted financial sanctions
against TF.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do?</strong>
</p>
<p>Registered dealers should take reference from the TF NRA in assessing
your TF risks and enhance your controls as appropriate. You are encouraged
to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Be alert to the potential vulnerabilities</strong>&nbsp;outlined
in the TF NRA. PSPM tend to be good stores of value and accepted as an
alternative to monies and could be used to move or raise funds for terrorism.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take the appropriate risk mitigation</strong>&nbsp;measures which
include the following:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remain <strong>vigilant</strong> when conducting transactions
or establishing business relationships;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct customer due diligence which includes <strong>screening customer names</strong> against
the lists of designated individuals and entities;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) to the
police immediately if you have information about transactions or proposed
transactions related to designated terrorists; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Freeze any assets or property belonging to designated
terrorists within 24 hours.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your customer happens to be <strong>in the terrorist designation or financial sanction list</strong>,
you should take the following actions:</p>
<p>(a) Decline to enter into any transaction with the customer;</p>
<p>(b) Terminate any transaction entered into with the customer;</p>
<p>(c) Make a STR to the police; and</p>
<p>(d) At the time of making the STR/police report or immediately thereafter,
submit a copy of the report to the Registrar.</p>
