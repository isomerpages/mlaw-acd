<p>Dear Regulated Dealer,</p>
<p>The Environmental Crimes Money Laundering National Risk Assessment (Env
Crimes ML NRA) presents an overview of Singapore’s Env Crimes ML risk environment,
identifies the key threats and vulnerabilities in environmental crimes
ML that Singapore is exposed to, and outlines risk mitigation measures.</p>
<p>Singapore’s key exposure to environmental crimes ML stems from its position
as a transit country:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As an <strong>international</strong>  <strong>trading and transportation hub</strong>,
Singapore is sited on the supply route where <strong>high volume of wildlife and environmental goods </strong>are
moved using sea route, which make Singapore susceptible to trade flows
arising from environmental crime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an <strong>international</strong>  <strong>financial centre</strong>,
there is potential for illicit funds from environmental crimes to flow
through Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Singapore’s key environmental crimes ML threats come from:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Illegal wildlife trade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Illegal logging and the illegal timber trade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trafficking of hazardous waste</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of environmental crimes&nbsp;<strong>includes illegal mining,</strong>&nbsp;which
refers to mining activity that is undertaken without state permission or
with state permission obtained through corruption.</p>
<p>Corruption, bribery and tax evasion offences may also be linked to environmental
crimes.</p>
<p><strong>Why are environmental crimes a concern?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the key concerns highlighted in the report are:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Environmental crimes and the laundering of their proceeds endanger the
environment and have a far-reaching impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criminals could launder proceeds from environmental goods though layering,
under the guise of loans or payments, and using cash deposits, electronic
payments, and third-party wire transfers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criminals may use shell companies to hide beneficial owners to lauder
proceeds from environmental crimes such as illegal mining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proceeds from environmental crimes, or from corruption, bribery, or tax
evasion linked to environmental crimes, may be used to purchase precious
stones, precious metals, or precious products (PSPM) to hide the illicit
origin of these funds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What can you do?</strong>
</p>
<p>Regulated Dealers should take reference from the Env Crimes ML NRA in
assessing your environmental crimes ML risks and enhance your controls
as appropriate. You are encouraged to :</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Be alert to the potential vulnerabilities</strong>&nbsp;outlined
in the Env Crimes ML NRA. PSPM tend to be good stores of value and accepted
as an alternative to monies and could be used in the layering and integration
of funds in ML transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take the appropriate risk mitigation</strong>&nbsp;measures&nbsp;such
as&nbsp;understanding, detecting and reporting suspicious transactions
to guard against the Env Crimes ML risk that your business may be abused,
where relevant.</p>
