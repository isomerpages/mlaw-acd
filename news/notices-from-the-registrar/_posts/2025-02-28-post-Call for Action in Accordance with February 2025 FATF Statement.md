<p>Dear Regulated Dealer,</p>
<p><strong><u>Action by regulated dealers against high-risk jurisdictions</u></strong>

<p>The Registrar of Regulated Dealers hereby notifies all regulated dealers
that the Financial Action Task Force (“<strong>FATF</strong>”) has issued
statements dated 21 February 2025&nbsp;on:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>

<li>
<p>Enhanced due diligence measures against Myanmar; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List of Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring.</p>
<p></p>

</ul>
<p>Accordingly, under regulation 7(1) of the Precious Stones and Precious
Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering, Terrorism Financing and Proliferation
Financing) Regulations 2019 (“<strong>PMLTF Regulations</strong>”), regulated
dealers <strong>must perform enhanced customer due diligence measures</strong> if:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The customer, or the person on whose behalf the customer is acting on,
is from or in DPRK, Iran, Myanmar, or a foreign country or territory identified
to have inadequate measures to prevent money laundering or terrorism financing;
