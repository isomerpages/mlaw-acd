In the Notice from the Registrar to regulated dealers on 14 December 2020, the Registrar of Regulated Dealers notified all regulated dealers that they are required to submit semi-annual returns related to their business and transactions with effect from **1 January 2021**.

**Background**
 
The purpose of the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act 2019 (“**PSPM Act**”), is to combat money laundering and terrorism financing in the precious stones and precious metals industry. In order for the Ministry of Law to properly regulate and supervise the regulated dealers, reliable and timely information has to be collected from all regulated dealers.

With effect from 1 January 2021, regulated dealers are required to submit mandatory semi-annual returns related to their business and transactions. The first reporting period will be from 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021, and the first submission will be due within 30 days, i.e. by 30 July 2021. Regulated dealers should to refer to the content for reporting set out by the Ministry of Law to understand the reporting requirements and ensure that the information are collected in the required format during the reporting period.
