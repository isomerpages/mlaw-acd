Dear Regulated Dealer,

**LAUNCH OF SCREENING FUNCTION IN MYPAL**

You may now access the screening function via your [*my*Pal](https://go.gov.sg/mypal){:target="blank"} account. We would like to remind you that the screening function is only intended for the purpose of screening names against the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act (“***TSOFA***”) or United Nations (“**UN**”) sanction lists and does not screen names against any other database and must not be used for any other purpose.

**Guidance Video and Instruction Guide**

A [guidance video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6at7WyPxRs){:target="blank"} has been prepared to provide guidance to regulated dealers on how to use the screening function. The video also includes the different outcomes that a regulated dealer might encounter when using the screening function, how to dismiss false positive hits and saving of your screening results. You may also refer to the [instruction guide (with screenshots)](/files/Screening%20Module%20Instruction%20Guide_20220901.pdf){:target="blank"} on how to navigate and use the screening function.

**Frequently Asked Questions**
