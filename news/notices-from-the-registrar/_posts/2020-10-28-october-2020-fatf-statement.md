On 23 October 2020, the FATF, of which Singapore is a member, issued a statement that highlights the strategic deficiencies in the anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes of the DPRK and Iran. While there was a pause in the review process for the list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, and the statements may not necessarily reflect the most recent status of both DPRK and Iran, <b>the FATF's call for action on them remains in effect.</b><br><br>
• DPRK and Iran are subject to the FATF’s call on countries to apply counter-measures. The FATF calls on its members and urges all jurisdictions to apply effective counter-measures and targeted financial sanctions to protect the international financial system from the ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorism financing risks.<br><br>Full details can be found at:<br><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/documents/call-for-action-october-2020.html" target="_blank">https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/documents/call-for-action-october-2020.html</a><br><br>
