<p>Dear Regulated Dealer,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
Industry Partnership (ACIP)<sup>1</sup> Counter-Proliferation Financing
(CPF) Working Group, in consultation with industry across various financial
and non-financial sectors, has produced an industry best practice paper
(BPP), <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/external-publications/countering-proliferation-financing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“Countering Proliferation Financing – Industry Perspectives on Best Practices”</a>.
The BPP sets out observed proliferation financing (PF) typologies that
Singapore is exposed to, PF risk factors and recommended best practices
for assessing and mitigating PF risks. The paper is intended to complement
<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/monographs-or-information-paper/2024/proliferation-financing-national-risk-assessment-and-counter-pf-strategy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore’s PF National Risk Assessment</a>(PF NRA) and existing guidance,
and provide practical suggestions to both financial institutions (FIs)
and non-FIs in their assessment and management of PF and sanctions evasion
risks.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Regulated dealers are strongly encouraged to review this BPP and assess</strong> how
the typologies, risk factors and best practices described within can be
factored into their existing frameworks to better mitigate PF and sanctions
evasion risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Should You Do?</strong>
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulated dealers
are reminded to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Have controls and processes in place to identify, assess, understand and manage your PF risks, and to ensure continued compliance with Regulations made under the United Nations Act</strong>,
especially the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/UNA2001-S570-2010" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">United Nations (Sanctions — Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations 2010</a> and
the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/UNA2001-S544-2019" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">United Nations (Sanctions — Iran) Regulations 2019</a> (UN
Sanctions Regulations). In line with existing guidance, these controls
and processes need not be standalone CPF controls and processes and can
be part of your AML/CFT framework.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File suspicious transaction reports (STRs) if necessary and as soon as possible with the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office in line with the requirements </strong>under
the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation
of Benefits) Act 1992 (CDSA) as offences under the various UN Sanctions
Regulations are ML predicate offences. In particular, where there is a
positive sanctions hit involving an individual or entity designated by
the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), an STR should be filed as soon
as possible and no later than one business day. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Immediately inform MinLaw</strong> by emailing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">amlcftcpf@mlaw.gov.sg</a> if
you have frozen the assets of an individual or entity designated by the
UNSC, copying the officers-in-charge of your entity and <strong>file an STR as soon as possible and no later than one business day</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep up-to-date with PF typologies</strong> including those featured
in Singapore’s PF NRA (which includes sector-specific PF typologies), as
well as the Financial Action Task Force’s reports. You should also be <strong>alert to emerging PF typologies and sanctions evasion techniques, and continue to strengthen your controls</strong> to
target risks, including through the use of data analytics.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review Singapore’s PF NRA to have a better understanding of Singapore’s key PF threats</strong> (i.e.
misuse of legal persons, ship-to-ship transfers, movement of dual-use goods,
export of luxury goods<sup>2</sup> and misuse of virtual assets) and higher-PF
risk sectors (i.e. banks, digital payment token service providers, corporate
service providers, remittance agents, maritime insurers, precious stones
and precious metals dealers, and lawyers).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should assess the extent of your exposure of your customer base and
activities to Singapore’s key PF threats and relevant PF risk factors as
set out in the PF NRA. Where relevant, you should pay particular attention
to risk factors that are specific to your sector, and implement commensurate
measures.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should also have a good understanding of your PF risks and have in
place robust controls.</p>
</li>
