<p>Dear Regulated Dealer,</p>
<p>The identification, assessment and understanding of risks underpin the
effectiveness of Singapore’s efforts in anti-money laundering (“<strong>AML</strong>”),
countering the financing of terrorism (“<strong>CFT</strong>”) and countering
proliferation financing (“<strong>CPF</strong>”). As part of Singapore’s
efforts to keep pace with changing risks, trends and typologies, Singapore
monitors our ML, terrorism financing (“<strong>TF</strong>”) and PF risks
through close coordination across government agencies and in collaboration
with the industry. To maintain the effectiveness of Singapore’s AML/CFT/CPF
regime, and support and enhance the industry’s collective risk awareness,
Singapore published the following risk assessments and strategies on 30
October 2024:</p>
<p>i. <strong>Proliferation Financing National Risk Assessment and Counter-PF Strategy (“PF NRA and CPF Strategy”)</strong>,
which updates and deepens Singapore’s PF risk understanding, taking into
consideration observations by relevant Singapore authorities, international
typologies and feedback from the private sector.</p>
<p>ii. <strong>Legal Persons Risk Assessment (“LPRA”), Legal Arrangements Risk Assessment (“LARA”), and Virtual Assets Risk Assessment (“VARA”)</strong>,
which are thematic risk assessments that complement Singapore’s updated
ML NRA and TF NRA published on 20 June 2024 and 1 July 2024 respectively.
These thematic risk assessments provide a more targeted and in-depth understanding
of Singapore’s key threats and vulnerabilities in these specific risk areas
and are particularly relevant to sectors that have been referenced in the
reports.</p>
<p>iii. <strong>National Anti-Money Laundering Strategy (“National AML Strategy”)</strong>,
which sets out the strategic approach to address ML risks and will guide
Singapore’s risk-targeted actions to combat ML amidst rapidly changing
risks, trends and criminal typologies.</p>
<p>iv. <strong>Law Enforcement Strategy to Combat ML</strong>, which supports
the National AML Strategy, articulates the shared commitment by law enforcement
agencies to combat ML and addresses the key ML threats identified in the
2024 ML NRA.</p>
<p>2 Further information on the (i) PF NRA and CPF Strategy and (ii) VARA,
which make reference to and/or are relevant to the PSMD sector are highlighted
below. (<u>Note</u>: Registered Dealers should take reference from <strong><u>all</u></strong> of
Singapore’s risk assessments and national strategies in identifying, assessing
and understanding your ML/TF/PF risks, assessing your AML/CFT/CPF controls
and enhance your controls as appropriate.)</p>
<h5><strong>PF NRA and CPF Strategy</strong></h5>
<p>3 Singapore’s PF NRA and CPF Strategy consolidates the PF risks observed
by Singapore authorities, private sector players and foreign experts –
recognising that Singapore’s status as an international financial centre
and key trading and transhipment hub makes us susceptible to PF risks.</p>
<p>4 Amongst other things, Singapore authorities have observed the <strong>misuse of legal persons</strong> for
PF purposes, such as the:</p>
<p>i. Use of Singapore operating companies, including those which are long-established,
to trade with sanctioned entities with <strong>transactions layered</strong> through
front companies and accounts in third countries;</p>
<p>ii. Setting up of separate legal persons to <strong>ringfence sanctioned activities</strong>;</p>
<p>iii. Use of <strong>shell companies</strong> set up by foreign beneficial
owners with little or no substantial business operations in Singapore.</p>
<p>5 Having identified Singapore’s key PF threats, the PF NRA and CPF Strategy
ascertained the sectors with greater exposure to these threats. According
to the PF NRA and CPF Strategy, the <strong>precious stones and precious metals dealers (“PSMD”) sector</strong>  <strong>is assessed to be a sector to watch</strong>.
The PSMD sector:</p>
<p>i. <strong>Is exposed to key PF threats</strong> as PSMDs provide an alternative
method for United Nations Security Council (“<strong>UNSC</strong>”)-designated
individuals and entities to surreptitiously move financial resources across
international borders, with UNSC-designated individuals and entities engaging
such dealers to transport gold and diamonds to obtain foreign exchanges
to finance their transactions; and</p>
<p>ii. <strong>Has a varied level of PF risk awareness </strong>due to it
being one of the more recently AML/CFT-regulated sectors in Singapore –
though this has improved over time.</p>
<h5><strong>VARA</strong></h5>
<p>6 Given the fast pace of developments within the virtual assets space,
Singapore is cognisant of the importance of keeping abreast of emerging
risks. Due to <strong>virtual assets’ higher inherent risks</strong>, Singapore
continues to pay attention to these emerging risks to ensure that our AML/CFT/CPF
regime addresses these risks. The findings of the VARA complement existing
risk assessments published and seek to provide deeper insights into specific
risk areas and enable the industry to adopt a more targeted approach to
address the relevant risks.</p>
<p>7 According to the VARA, <strong>PSMDs could be exposed to ML/TF/PF risks arising from the acceptance of digital payment tokens (“DPTs”)</strong>,
which may carry inherent risks due to the features of DPTs themselves.
Notwithstanding, under the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention
of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Regulations 2019, <strong>PSMDs are required to conduct customer due diligence on the person before entering into the transaction if the payment in DPTs exceeds S$20,000</strong>.
On the whole, threats raised in international reports and observed by law
enforcement agencies and the industry have also not revealed a nexus between
virtual assets and PSMDs.</p>
<h5><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></h5>
<p>8 Regulated Dealers should take into account the relevant ML/TF/PF risks
and threats identified within Singapore’s risk assessments (including the
above risk assessments and the updated ML and TF National Risk Assessments
published on 20 June 2024 and 1 July 2024 respectively) to identify, assess
and understand ML/TF/PF risks, and assess the effectiveness of your AML/CFT/CPF
controls and ongoing monitoring of customers and transactions. As a regulated
dealer, your <strong>risk assessment</strong> should:</p>
<p>i. Be approved by your senior management;</p>
<p>ii. Enable a deeper understanding of your overall vulnerability to ML/TF/PF
risks; and</p>
<p>iii. Form the basis for your implementation of relevant risk-focused AML/CFT/CPF
controls and mitigation measures.</p>
