- **<u>New applications</u>** – The application fee for new entrants will be reduced from S$140 to S$120.

Otherwise, it will be S$350 per outlet per year. See table below for schedule.
- **<u>Registration period</u>** – New registrations and renewals will be valid for one (1) year.
- **<u>Transition period</u>** – Regulated dealers who have a valid registration before 10 April 2021, will continue with their registration until expiry.

**New Notification Requirements**

Regulation 21 of the PMLTF Regulations is amended to simplify the notification requirements for registered dealers. Instead of notifying the Registrar 14 days in advance, a registered dealer must notify the Registrar within 14 days <u>after</u> any of the following matters occurs:

- any change in the business name or registered office of the registered dealer;
- any change in the address of the registered dealer given to the Registrar for the service of documents;
- any change in telephone number, facsimile number, email address or other contact details of the registered dealer; or
- any change of any key personnel of the registered dealer.
