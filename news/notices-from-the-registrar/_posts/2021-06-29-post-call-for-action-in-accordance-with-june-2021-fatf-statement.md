**Action by regulated dealers against high-risk jurisdictions**<br>

The Registrar of Regulated Dealers hereby notifies all regulated dealers that the Financial Action Task Force (“**FATF**”) has issued statements dated 25 June 2021 on:
* Counter-measures<sup>1</sup> against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (“**DPRK**”) and Iran; and
* List of Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring.
    
Accordingly, under regulation 7(1) of the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Regulations 2020 ("**PMLTF Regulations**"), regulated dealers **must perform enhanced customer due diligence** ("**ECDD**") **measures** if:
* The customer, or the person on whose behalf the customer is acting on, is from or in DPRK, Iran or a foreign country or territory identified to have inadequate measures to prevent money laundering or terorrism financing; or
* The transaction relates to DPRK, Iran, or a foreign country or territory identified to have inadequate measures to prevent money laundering or terrorism financing.

Regulated dealers are also expected to take the List of Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring into consideration when preparing their risk assessment and mitigation plans and perform ECDD measures, when necessary.

    <th class="tg-exjp">June 2021 FATF Statement: <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action</span><br>
On 25 June 2021, the FATF, of which Singapore is a member, issued a statement that highlights the strategic deficiencies in the anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes of the DPRK and Iran. While there was a pause in the review process for the list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, and the statement may not necessarily reflect the most recent status of both DPRK and Iran, <b>the FATF's call for action on them remains in effect.</b><br><br>
• DPRK and Iran are subject to the FATF’s call on countries to apply counter-measures. The FATF calls on its members and urges all jurisdictions to apply effective counter-measures and targeted financial sanctions to protect the international financial system from the ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorism financing risks.<br><br>Full details can be found at:<br><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/documents/call-for-action-june-2021.html" target="_blank">https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/documents/call-for-action-june-2021.html</a><br><br>
