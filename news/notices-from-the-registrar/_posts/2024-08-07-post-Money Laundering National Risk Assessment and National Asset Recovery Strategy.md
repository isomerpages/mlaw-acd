<p>Dear Registered Dealer,</p>
<p>As part of Singapore’s continuing efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of its anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism
("<strong>AML/CFT</strong>") regime, and to keep pace with best practices
as recommended by the Financial Action Task Force ("<strong>FATF</strong>"),
Singapore had published its updated Money Laundering National Risk Assessment
("<strong>ML NRA</strong>") and National Asset Recovery Strategy ("<strong>NARS</strong>")
in June 2024.</p>
<p>To support this effort, ACD has prepared the following key highlights
from the ML NRA and the NARS for registered dealers to note and take action.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>ML NRA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore’s ML NRA consolidates the ML risks observed by Singapore law
enforcement agencies and supervisory authorities, as well as feedback from
private sector entities and counterpart foreign authorities.</p>
<p>As an international business, financial and trading centre, Singapore
is exposed to external threats arising from predicate offences that have
a foreign nexus.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Key ML threats</strong> faced by Singapore include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Fraud, particularly cyber-enabled fraud</strong> (e.g. foreign
fraud or fraud committed domestically but orchestrated by syndicates typically
located overseas)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Foreign organised crime</strong> (e.g. illegal online gambling)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corruption</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tax crimes</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trade-based ML</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Criminal breach of trust </strong>(remains as Singapore’s key
domestic ML threat)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unlicensed moneylending</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the ML NRA 2024, the <strong>precious stones and precious metals dealers (PSMD) sector</strong> is
assessed as presenting <strong>medium-high ML risk</strong>. PSMDs are more
vulnerable to ML risk due to the following factors:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Precious stones and precious metals ("<strong>PSPM</strong>") generally
possess <strong>high intrinsic value</strong> in a relatively compact form
that potentially maintains or increases in value over time, which makes
it attractive to money launderers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PSPMs facilitate the <strong>anonymity of ownership</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The retail PSPM sector deals largely with walk-in and one-off customers,
which includes <strong>exposure to foreign customers</strong> who may be
tourists <strong>from higher risk jurisdictions</strong>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment in cash, digital payment tokens and through bartering gold, especially
for large transactions, poses higher ML risk as it facilitates the <strong>anonymity of transactions, </strong>makes
it harder to <strong>trace the original source</strong> and allows the payer
to <strong>hide their identity.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore has also developed its<strong> </strong>NARS which focuses on
the following <strong>four pillars</strong>:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Detect</strong> suspicious and criminal activities by tracing the
illicit funds;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deprive</strong> criminals of their ill-gotten proceeds through
prompt seizure and confiscation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deliver</strong> maximum recovery of assets for forfeiture and
restitution to victims; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deter</strong> criminals from using Singapore to hide, move, or
enjoy their illicit assets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What can you do?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registered Dealers should take reference from the ML NRA in assessing
your ML risks and enhance your controls as appropriate. You are encouraged
to:</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Be alert to the potential vulnerabilities</strong>&nbsp;outlined
in the ML NRA. PSPM tend to be good stores of value and accepted as an
alternative to monies and could be used in the layering and integration
of funds in ML transactions. Case studies in the ML NRA also show how proceeds
from suspected overseas criminal activities and domestic fraud have been
used to purchase gold bars, luxury watches, and jewellery.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take the appropriate risk mitigation </strong>measures such as
understanding, detecting and reporting suspicious transactions to guard
against the ML risks that your business may be abused, where relevant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
