The [Guidelines for Regulated Dealers in the Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers Sector on Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism ("**Guidelines**")](/files/guidelines for regulated dealers_20231115_v3.0.pdf){:target="_blank"} are meant to help regulated dealers understand the regulatory requirements under the [Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act 2019 (“**PSPM Act**”)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PSPMPMLTFA2019){:target="_blank"} and [Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Regulations 2019 (“**PMLTF Regulations**”)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/PSPMPMLTFA2019-S306-2019?DocDate=20190408){:target="_blank"}.<a href="#footnote1"></a><br><br> 
The Guidelines also provide [sample forms and checklists<sup>1</sup>](/files/Guidelines for regulated dealers_Annexes_20231115_V3.0.docx){:target="_blank"} to assist regulated dealers in meeting their regulatory obligations.  <b>However, regulated dealers remain responsible for ensuring that their Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism ("**AML/CFT**") measures are appropriately designed for their business and commensurate with their money laundering/terrorism financing ("**ML/TF**") risk exposure.</b><br><br>
