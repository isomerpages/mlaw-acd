####  Risk Assessment and Internal Policies, Procedures and Controls

Regulated dealers are required to perform an assessment of the money laundering (**"ML"**) and terrorism financing (**"TF"**) risks faced by their business. They are also required to develop internal policies, procedures and controls (**"IPPC"**) to manage their ML/TF risks.
