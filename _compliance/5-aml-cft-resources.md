#### 2. Monetary Authority of Singapore's ("**MAS**") website - Lists of Designated Individuals and Entities

MAS publishes [lists](https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/anti-money-laundering/targeted-financial-sanctions/lists-of-designated-individuals-and-entities){:target="_blank"} of individuals and entities designated under the United Nations Act ("**UN Act**") and the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act ("**TSOFA**"). Regulated dealers should [subscribe](https://www.mas.gov.sg/subscription-services){:target="_blank"} to the MAS mailing list to receive updated lists of designated individuals and entities. Regulated dealers are required to screen their customers against the lists before engaging in any business or commercial activity with them.<br><br>
You may refer to the [MAS Website Subscriber Services Guide](/images/MAS%20Website%20Subscriber%20Services%20Guide_20191105_V1Final.pdf){:target="_blank"} for a step-by-step guide to the subscription process.<br>

#### 3. Inter-Ministry Committee on Terrorist Designation ("**IMC-TD**")

The IMC-TD acts as Singapore's authority relating to the designation of terrorists. This prohibits any person/ entity from dealing with or providing any financial assistance to designated subjects, as required under the TSOFA.

On MHA’s website on [IMC-TD](https://www.mha.gov.sg/inter-ministry-committee-terrorist-designation-(imc-td)){:target="_blank"}, you will find information on counter terrorism financing legislation, IMC-TD’s process of designation, and relevant news articles.
