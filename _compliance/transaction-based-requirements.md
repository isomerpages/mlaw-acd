#### <a id="Customer Due Diligence"></a> Customer Due Diligence

CDD is the process of obtaining your customers' identifying information, recording the information and verifying who they are before transacting with them. The objective is to help you determine the money laundering/terrorism financing/proliferation financing ("**ML/TF/PF**") risks and take appropriate mitigating measures to address them.

In the event where you are unable to perform or complete the required CDD, you must not proceed with the transaction. You should terminate any transaction entered into with the customer and consider whether to file a STR. If you suspect that the customer is in the listings for terrorist designation and designated individuals and entities, you must stop the transaction and report to the police. Please refer to the [Guidelines](/files/guidelines for regulated dealers_20231115_v3.0.pdf){:target="_blank"} for more information.

#### <a id="Enhanced Customer Due Diligence"></a> Enhanced Customer Due Diligence

Where the ML/TF/PF risks are identified to be higher, regulated dealers are expected to take ECDD measures to mitigate and manage those risks.

Please refer to the <a target="_blank" href="/files/guidelines for regulated dealers_20231115_v3.0.pdf">Guidelines</a> (Published Date: 15 Nov 2023) for more information.

Regulated dealers who enter into any designated transaction<sup>1</sup> must submit a CTR electronically to the STRO within 15 business days via [SONAR](https://www.police.gov.sg/sonar){:target="_blank"}. As part of record keeping, you are required to keep a copy of the filed CTR for 5 years after the date of submission.

#### <a id="Suspicious Transaction Report"></a> Suspicious Transaction Report

Regulated dealers are required to file a STR when there are suspicions on ML/TF/PF activities in the business transaction. This should be filed electronically via [SONAR](https://www.police.gov.sg/sonar){:target="_blank"}. Regulated dealers are reminded that it is an offence under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act ("**CDSA**") to tip off another person on a STR filed with STRO.

Please refer to the [STRO website](https://www.police.gov.sg/advisories/crime/commercial-crimes/suspicious-transaction-reporting-office){:target="_blank"} on how to file a STR.
