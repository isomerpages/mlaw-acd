Pursuant to the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering, Terrorism Financing and Proliferation Financing) Regulations 2019 (“**PMLTFPF Regulations**”), registered dealers have the duty to notify the Registrar of Regulated Dealers of change in particulars and circumstances.

The notification is to be submitted in **GoBusiness Dashboard** via an amendment application. You need to tick the checkbox (for each section that you wish to amend) in order to update your records with MinLaw. Refer to the table below for more details on how to submit the amendment application.

**Note: Cancellation of Registration**

If you do not wish to continue operating as a registered dealer (i.e. you are neither carrying on the business of regulated dealing nor business as an intermediary for regulated dealing), submit a cancellation application via the [GoBusiness Dashboard](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/licences){:target="_blank"}. Fees are not payable for cancellation application.



#### <a id="Ongoing Monitoring of Transactions"></a> Ongoing Monitoring of Transactions

Regulated dealers are required to conduct ongoing monitoring of the transactions carried out by your customer to ascertain that they are consistent with your knowledge of the customer.

Regulated dealers are required to periodically review the adequacy of information and documents obtained as a result of the customer due diligence ("**CDD**") measures, particularly in cases where there is a higher risk of money laundering/terrorism financing/proliferation financing ("**ML/TF/PF**"). This is to ensure that the information is kept current and relevant.

#### <a id="Record Keeping"></a> Record Keeping

Regulated dealers are required to keep relevant documents and information for a period of 5 years after the date of transaction, or the date that the information or supporting document is obtained.

A registered dealer may also be asked to keep relevant documents and information for a prescribed period after ceasing to be a registered dealer. If the registered dealer is found to have disposed records during the period of the registration, the registered dealer will be liable for enforcement action against them. With effect from 1 May 2024, regulated dealers that cease registration as regulated dealers, are still subject to this record keeping requirement and must continue to keep these documents and information for the 5 year period.


#### <a id="Notices from the Registrar"></a> Notices from the Registrar

The Registrar of Regulated Dealers regularly issues notices to all regulated dealers with respect to measures for the prevention of ML/TF/PF. These include [Guidelines](/files/guidelines_for_regulated_dealers_130226_v5.pdf){:target="_blank"} (Published Date: 13 Feb 2026) to help regulated dealers understand their regulatory requirements and publications by the Financial Action Task Force ("**FATF**").
