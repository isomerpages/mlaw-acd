The Ministry of Law will put in place a new anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (“**AML/CFT**”) regulatory regime for precious stones and precious metals dealers (“**PSMDs**”) in Singapore. 

The PSMD sector is exposed to inherent money-laundering (“**ML**”) and terrorism financing (“**TF**”) risks, as precious stones and precious metals are good stores of value, easily transported and concealed, and easily convertible to cash. 

The new AML/CFT regime will strengthen existing measures against ML/TF risks by establishing a comprehensive supervisory and regulatory regime that is risk-focused and which addresses the specific ML/TF risks in the PSMD sector. 

The Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Bill (“**PSMD Bill**”) was passed by Parliament on 11 February 2019. The PSMD Bill is now being reviewed by the President and is expected to take effect in the second quarter of 2019.

**Registration** <br>
Regulated dealers are required to register their business with the Ministry of Law and will have up to 6 months to register after the PSMD Bill takes effect. More information on the registration process will be provided at a later date. <br><br>
The Ministry of Law will provide further guidance when the details have been finalised and will conduct outreach efforts to ensure that regulated dealers are well-placed to comply with the new regime.

<p align ="center"><b><a id="info" style="text-decoration:none">Information on the Regime </a></b></p>

**Who does the new regime cover?** <br>
The regime will cover regulated dealers.

A “regulated dealer” is any person who carries on a business:<br>
(a)	of regulated dealing; or <br>
(b)	as an intermediary for regulated dealing.

“Regulated dealing” means: <br>
(a)	selling, offering for sale, purchasing for the purpose of resale, importing for sale, possessing for sale, or manufacturing any “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product”; or <br>
(b)	selling or redeeming any “asset-backed token”. 

**Examples** <br>
Regulated dealers include, but are not limited to, jewellers, bullion traders, jewellery wholesalers, jewellery retailers and second-hand goods dealers. The regime also applies to regulated dealers who are based overseas but carry on a business of regulated dealing in Singapore.<br>
Intermediaries for regulated dealing who are covered under the regime include, but are not limited to, auction houses and trading platforms.<br><br>
Importantly, the regime does **not** intend to cover individuals who make one-off purchases and subsequently decide to sell their items to a second-hand goods dealer. Further, pawnbrokers are **not** regulated dealers as they are already subject to AML/CFT measures under the Pawnbrokers Act.<br>
<br>

**What does the new regime cover?** <br>
“Precious stones” include diamonds, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, jade, and pearls <br>
“Precious metals” include gold, silver, platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, and alloys with at least 2% in weight of any of the metals stated above.<br>
“Precious products” include, but are not limited to, any jewellery, watch, apparel, accessory, ornament or other finished product that is: <br>
(a) made up of, contains or has attached to it any precious stone or metal or both; and<br>
(b) derives at least 50% of its value is attributable to the precious stone or precious metal or both.

An “asset-backed token” is any token, certificate or instrument: <br>
(i) backed by one or more “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product”; and <br>
(ii) that entitles the holder to the “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product” or part of it (e.g. certificates or tokens).

Asset-backed tokens **do not include** securities or derivative contracts within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Act, or commodity contracts within the meaning of the Commodity Trading Act. Securities contracts, derivative contracts and commodity contracts are **not** covered under the new regime.

<br>

**What do regulated dealers have to do?** <br>

Under this regime, the requirements that apply to regulated dealers include, but are not limited to, the following:
 * Register their business with the Ministry of Law within 6 months after the PSMD Bill takes effect
 * Perform customer due diligence measures under circumstances that are prescribed by the PSMD Bill
 * File Suspicious Transaction Reports (**STR**) with the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (**STRO**) and the Ministry of Law where there is suspicion of ML/TF 
 * File Cash Transaction Reports (**CTR**) with STRO and the Ministry of Law for cash transactions exceeding $20,000
 * Keep records of the following documents/information for a period of five years or such other prescribed period:
   * transactions where customer due diligence was conducted;
   * information obtained from customer due diligence;
   * CTRs that have been filed and 
   * STRs that have been filed
 * Conduct risk assessments to determine the ML/TF risk posed by its customers and transactions
 * Put in place internal policies, procedures and controls to mitigate the specific ML/TF risks identified by their risk assessments
