<p align="center"><b><a id="overview"> Overview </a> </b></p>

The Ministry of Law will put in place a new anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (“**AML/CFT**”) regulatory regime for precious stones and precious metals dealers (“**PSMDs**”) in Singapore. 

The PSMD sector is exposed to inherent money-laundering (“**ML**”) and terrorism financing (“**TF**”) risks, as precious stones and precious metals are good stores of value, easily transported and concealed, and easily convertible to cash. 

The new AML/CFT regime will mitigate these ML and TF risks, level up AML/CFT standards and increase trust within the sector.

The Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Bill (“**PSMD Bill**”) was passed by Parliament on 11 February 2019. The new law is expected to take effect in the second quarter of 2019.

**Registration** <br>
Regulated dealers are required to register their business with the Ministry of Law. More information on the registration process will be provided at a later date. The Ministry of Law will provide further guidance when the details have been finalised and will conduct outreach efforts to ensure that regulated dealers are well-placed to comply with the new regime.

(b)	selling or redeeming any “asset-backed token”. 

**Examples** <br>
Regulated dealers include, but are not limited to, jewellers, bullion traders, jewellery wholesalers, jewellery retailers and second-hand goods dealers. 
Intermediaries for regulated dealing who are covered under the regime include, but are not limited to, auction houses and trading platforms. 
Pawnbrokers are **not** regulated dealers as they are already subject to AML/CFT measures under the Pawnbrokers Act.

<br>

**What does the new regime cover?** <br>

“Precious metals” include gold, silver, platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, and alloys with at least 2% in weight of any of the metals stated above.<br>

(a) made up of, contains or has attached to it any precious stone or metal or both; and<br>
(b) derives at least 50% of its value is attributable to the precious stone or precious metal or both.

An “asset-backed token” is any token, certificate or instrument: <br>
(i) backed by one or more “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product”; and <br>
(ii) that entitles the holder to the “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product” or part of it (e.g. certificates or tokens).
