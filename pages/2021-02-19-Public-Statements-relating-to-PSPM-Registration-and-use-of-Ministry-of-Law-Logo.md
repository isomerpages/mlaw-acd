Regulated dealers are to ensure that their websites, representations and publicity materials do not cause the public to misconstrue that the Registrar of Regulated Dealers of the Ministry of Law (“**the Registrar**”) is regulating them beyond anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (“**AML/CFT**”) matters. Regulated dealers should also not make unauthorised use of the Ministry of Law logo on their websites or in publicity materials such as newsletters, articles, business cards etc.


#### Public Statements relating to PSPM Registration

As stated in the Certificate of Registration, regulated dealers are registered by the Registrar in the business of regulated dealing or business as an intermediary for regulated dealing, <u>strictly for the purposes of AML/CFT</u>. Public statements and representations which suggest that Ministry of Law is regulating such businesses beyond AML/CFT matters could be misconstrued and may create unnecessary confusion amongst the public. Regulated dealers should take immediate appropriate action to correct any such public statements or representations which are unacceptable.
